<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Jonas Eguiron, an aspiring IT Professional. As of today, May 05 2023, I am currently a second year college in Technological Univerity of the Philippines - Taguig.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that lead me to this path, one was my hobby to play online games and that was already 3 years ago. I realized that maybe I can also make games like the ones that I am playing and have fun while working.</p>

<p>My main hobbies are playing chess and programming, I also got interested in an indoor sport which is badminton. I tried playing other physical and outdoor sports but my main extracurricular activity would be playing chess.</p>
